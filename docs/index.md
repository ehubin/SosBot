# How does it work?

The bot will create a reservoir-raid  and showdown channel in your discord.
Then you can go in these channels and type commands to register or manage these events.
Some of the advanced commands require you to have the R4 role.

## Reservoir raid commands

### register
type that as a user when you want to register yourself to the next event.
### list
Provides the list of currently registered participants to next RR event
### teams
* When team composition is finalised allows to display the teams
* If team composition not finalised this command allows R4 to decide how many teams they want then save the team composition

### create
Allows to create the next RR event (you will need to provide a date). This is restricted to R4 only. It will wipe out the previous event's participant list
### closereg
