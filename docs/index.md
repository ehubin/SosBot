# How does it work?

The bot will create a reservoir-raid  and showdown channel in your discord if they don't exist already.
Then you can go in these channels and type commands to register or manage these events (see below for command list).
Some of the advanced commands require you to have the R4 role.They are highlighted with ![R4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) in command list below. The role will be created if it doesn't already exists. You need to assign it to your R4 members.
